After having a discussion, we noticed that the app will never be used on the webpage on the computer (no one will carry his computer to brew a coffee so this app is mostly designed to be on a phone), therefore, the team decided to scratch all the work done to represent the webpage and change it to make it look like the phone, thus, we divide the objective to the following:

- Sarkis homepage is done is accepted and merged
- Derek timer was amazing and working 
- Dante save recipe in working progress
- Eric saves recipe edit
- Daniel wireframe is amazing and was merged 
- The team decided to meet again on weekend for Retrospective meeting 2
