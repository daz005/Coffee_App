1. Dante\
Hey I'm Dante and I'm a senior student majoring in computer science. I'm a big fan of full-stack development! My favorite toolkits to use are ReactJS for the front-end and Typescript and PostgreSql for the backend and database! Some programming languages that I use are Python, Java, C++ and C. When I'm not coding, you could find me either going out for a culinary adventure because I love trying new cuisines out or playing my favorite video games!\
