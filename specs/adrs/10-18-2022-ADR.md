## Architecture Decision Record 1, 10-18-2022
Our first major decision in Caffeinated was deciding to create an app that tracks recipes for making coffee and other drinks.

We wanted to create an app that would
- Allow users to record their coffeemaking recipes and review them later
  - Big problem with making a good coffee is remembering what you did the time before. Want to make this as easy as possible
- Have a built in timer feature
  - Allow users to record how long to brew coffee without leaving the webapp
- View Recipe feature that allows users to see previous recipes they made and update them if necessary.
- Social feature that allows users to explore new recipes.
- Education section that allows beginners to get started making coffee and other drinks quickly.
- A coffee diary where users could write how they felt after drinking their coffee
- A caffeine tracker where users could track their daily or weekly caffeine intake
- This webapp should work on all devices so that the user can access their recipes wherever they want.

More information about these decisions can be found in [the brainstorm folder](../brainstorm/coffeeLogBrainstorm.md).
