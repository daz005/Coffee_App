## Architecture Decision Record 3, November 22nd, 2022
This ADR covers design decisions made on Nov 22, 2022, as we prepared for the final Sprint for our project.

One of the main pushes for this Sprint is to get the CI/CD pipeline more fleshed out and fully working. Details about the pipeline can be found [here](../../admin/cipipeline/phase1.md).

Next, this Sprint focusses on making our application as reliable and user friendly as possible, without overworking our team. To do this, we prioritized the highest impact features that are relatively simple to implement.

### Important Core Functionality
Same as the previous ADR, these features were mostly implemented by the team already 
- Creating, Editing, Deleting, and Viewing Coffee Recipes
- Downloading and Uploading Recipes for the User.
- Built in Timer, both for recipe creation and viewing
- Recipes stored in Local Storage as JSON objects
- Built for Mobile Devices. Mobile Friendly UI
  
### New Features
- Beginner Recipe Examples
  - Similar to Recipe Templates feature described in [ADR 2](11-08-2022-ADR.md), this feature gives first time users an example of what a recipe looks like, so they can easily jump in and start creating their own recipe.
  - Implementing this feature is as simple as adding a predefined object to local storage, and the feature is high impact. 
- Tea Color Theme
  - When the User creates a Tea Recipe, the color theme of the application is changed, which differentiates the user's Coffee and Tea drinks and minimizes confusion.

### UI/Flow Changes
- Edit Button in the `ViewRecipe` screen should save user edits made on the page, instead of redirecting the user to the `CreateRecipe` page.
  - This change was made for a more consistent user experience across different parts of the app.

### Discontinued Features
- Flexible recipes with any number of ingredients
  - Described in [ADR 2](11-08-2022-ADR.md), we discontinued this feature as the alternative was a lot simpler, both for the user and for implementation.
  - Now only the `Brew Time` ingredient has an associated timer, and there are other preset ingredients the user can fill in.
