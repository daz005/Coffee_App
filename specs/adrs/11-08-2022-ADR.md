## Architecture Decision Record 2, 11-08-2022
Our second major decision involved the overall design and layout of the app.

We reduced the scope of the app a significant amount because we realized our webapp may end up bloated with many features that are not core to the idea and vision of Caffeinated.

### Important, Necessary Features
- Creating, Editing, Deleting, and Viewing Coffee Recipes
- Downloading and Uploading Recipes for the User.
- Built in Timer, both for recipe creation and viewing
- Recipes stored in Local Storage as JSON objects
- Built for Mobile Devices. Mobile Friendly UI

### Nice to have Features
- Flexible recipes with any number of ingredients
  - Deep customizability for the user, allowing the app to be used for other drinks or even food
- Recipe Templates for beginners and veteran tea and coffeemakers.

### Webapp UI and Design
There would be 5 main Views in our app that the user would navigate through for the complete coffeemaking experience
- HomeScreen
  - Entry point, contains list of recipes and buttons to create new recipes
- CreateRecipe
  - Contains list of ingredients that gets updated as the user adds them
  - Ingredients have editable names and amounts.
  - Ingredients can have a timer attached to them
- CreateTimer   
  - Contains Count Up timer so the user can measure how long they have been brewing coffee.
- ViewRecipe
  - Contains non-editable list of ingredients
  - Ingredients with a timer icon can be clicked to go to the ViewTimer screen
  - The Edit button can be clicked to modify this recipe (by linking to the CreateRecipe view).
  - Recipes can be deleted using the Trash icon.
- ViewTimer
  - The user can start a Count Down timer that tells them when their Brew Time is over.

Detailed Descriptions of the design can be found in [wireframes.md](../design/wireframe.md).

### Discontinued Features
- Social Feature
  - Adding servers and networking, which this feature would require, would not be worth the time and effort to create a feature that not many would use.
  - Instead, we decided to make our recipes easily sharable by having easily sharable recipes documents that can users can send to eachother.
- Coffee Diary
  - Although interesting, this feature would add too much complexity to the simple recipe tracking.
- Multidevice Compatibility
  - Our webapp is made for making coffee, and users likely wouldn't want to use laptops for making coffee.
  - We decied our webapp should be mobile device focused.
